# boar

Fork of https://bitbucket.org/mats_ekberg/boar (previously hosted here:
https://code.google.com/p/boar/).

The branches `branches/*` will always be a perfect clone of the original
corresponding branch in the original project (which is versioned under
mercurial).
I’ll try and keep the branches as up-to-date as possible.

_Maintainer note_:
The conversion is done using `git-remote-hg` with a standard config. A
simple fetch of the `hg` remote should “Just Work™.”
